How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Faster to find what was changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    No need to hesistate to change things.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: divided in logical parts. Cons: forgetting to commit, takes extra time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git: Because files work together. Google Docs: Because documents are separate beings with not direct relation.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log when in the folder, git diff first_id second_id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You don't have to worry about forgetting test code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Nothing.
